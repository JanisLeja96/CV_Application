This is a WIP CV Editor made with Laravel in the backend and React in the frontend.
Backend to frontend communication is handled using an API.

At the moment you can only create new and view existing CVs. Editing is not supported yet.

## Setup

For setting up the back-end: [see here](https://github.com/JanisLeja96/CV_Application/blob/main/cv-application-backend/README.md)

For setting up the front-end: [see here](https://github.com/JanisLeja96/CV_Application/blob/main/cv-application-frontend/README.md)


## Further development

- Add option to edit/update existing CVs
- Add option to choose between multiple CV templates
- Add option to create custom sections
- Add additional pre-defined sections
- Fix dates not appearing properly
